Effective Date: 8/7/2023

Welcome to CryptoGain, a free, privacy-focused, crypto technical analysis app designed to provide you with premium chart indicators, push notifications for price alerts, market data tables, portfolio tracking, watchlists, and aggregated news articles. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you use CryptoGain.

    Information We Collect

As of now, CryptoGain collects the following types of data:

1.1 Advertising Identifiers: We collect and use advertising identifiers (e.g., the Advertising ID on Android and the IDFA on iOS) to support the display of non-intrusive advertisements within the app. These identifiers allow us to show relevant ads to non-premium users and help us keep the app free and available to all users.

1.2 App Interactions Data: We collect data related to how you interact with CryptoGain's features to improve the app's functionality, user experience, and performance. This includes anonymized data on app interactions, such as the number of times you visit specific pages or sections and features you engage with.

    How We Use Your Information

We use the collected data for the following purposes:

2.1 Advertisements: Advertising identifiers are used to display non-premium ads within the app. These ads help us support the app's existence while providing you with valuable cryptocurrency-related content.

2.2 App Improvement: We analyze app interactions data to identify patterns, usage trends, and areas for improvement. This analysis enables us to optimize app performance, fix bugs, and enhance user experience.

    Information Sharing

We do not share your personal information, including advertising identifiers and app interactions data, with any third parties for purposes other than displaying advertisements within CryptoGain.

    Your Choices

4.1 Advertising Personalization: As a user, you have the option to control personalized ads based on your advertising identifier. On Android, you can enable or disable ad personalization through the "Opt-out of Ads Personalization" setting in your device's Google settings. On iOS, you can enable or disable the "Limit Ad Tracking" option in your device's Privacy settings.

4.2 Premium Subscription: To enjoy an ad-free experience and access additional features, you have the option to subscribe to "CryptoGain X," our premium subscription. By subscribing, you support the app's development and enjoy an enhanced user experience.

    Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. However, no data transmission over the internet or mobile networks can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

    User Data Protection

We want to emphasize that we do not track or share any user-specific data related to watchlists, portfolios, price alerts, saved articles, chart layouts, technical indicators in use, screenshots shared by users, or the timeframes users use to view candlestick charts. All user-specific data and preferences remain securely stored on your device and are not accessed or shared by CryptoGain.
